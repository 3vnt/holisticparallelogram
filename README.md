## Overview

### Tech Stack
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [Sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

#### Webpack
Webpack bundles dependencies into one file, so that all dependencies can be loaded into the DOM with a single `<script>` tag.  Webpack starts with an entry file (`App.js`) and traverses the projectâ€™s dependencies based on the `import` and `export` statements in the code. It uses a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory to define which loaders are required for compilation and the destination of the output file.

## Usage

Make sure you have all [dependencies](#installing-dependencies) installed. Then, from within the root directory:
```
npm install
webpack
node server.js
```

Visit `localhost:4568` in the browser.

## Requirements

- Node 0.10.x
- Webpack 1.12.14

## Development

To compile client-side code and start the server, run:
```
webpack
node server.js
```

If you are developing on the client only, type `webpack-dev-server` into the CLI to start the server and visit `localhost:8080/client/` in the browser. This will watch the client-side JS files and reload the browser if any of them change, and will not compile a bundle.js file.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server webpack
```
