## Overview

### Tech Stack
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [Sequelize ORM](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

#### Webpack
Webpack bundles dependencies into one file, so that all dependencies can be loaded into the DOM with a single `<script>` tag.  Webpack starts with an entry file (`App.js`) and traverses the projectâ€™s dependencies based on the `import` and `export` statements in the code. It uses a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory to define which loaders are required for compilation and the destination of the output file.

## Usage
You'll need API keys for [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key) and for [Google Plus](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/oauth#acquiring-and-using-an-api-key). Add these to the config files in /server/config, following the format of the example files, and remove `.example` from the filename.
Make sure you have all [dependencies](#installing-dependencies) installed. Then, from within the root directory:
```
npm install
webpack
npm start
```

Visit `localhost:4568` in the browser.

## Requirements

- Node 0.10.x
- Webpack 1.12.14

## Development

To compile client-side code, run:
```
webpack --watch
```
`webpack --watch` will recompile a `bundle.js` file when any client-side JS files have changed.

In a separate shell, start the server by running:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:4568` in the browser.

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server webpack
```
